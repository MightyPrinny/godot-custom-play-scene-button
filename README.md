Hides the "Play Scene" button and adds a custom button that 
sets a project setting to the scene that has to be played.


Useful for games with custom scene switching, I personally use this
to make sure playing a scene from the editor is the same as loading
it normally in the game.


The setting with the scene is "application/run/custom_first_scene", it's also
a constant stored at CustomPlayButton.scene_setting.
